# This project aims at making a bot play the Wikipedia game

A player is given a starting wikipedia page and a target wikipedia page, the player has to get to the target page only by following links in the current page  

## Strategies :
* random : if the end page is not found, chooses a random link
* using nlp : chooses the word closest to the target in the page
